# Set
Come from the set theory
Primary use is to check the presence of an element inside it and ensure uniqueness of elements

## Implementation
Should have methods :
-  has() : Check if an element is present in the set, return a bool
- values(): Return the values of the set
- add() : Add an element inside a set if not already in, return a bool
- remove() :  Remove an element from the set, return a bool
- size() : Return the length oif the set
- union() : Return the union of two sets
- intersection() : Return a new set with elements only presents in both sets
- subset() : test if the set is a subset of another set
- asymdifference() : Return a set with differences of two sets
- symetricDifference (): Return a set with differences of two sets (elements in either set but not in both)
